Ground Lessons

Stage One

Overview
There are three sections of stage one. First, the student will build aeronautical experience on long VFR cross-countries. Second,  the student will build foundations for aircraft control in IMC conditions including upset recovery. The student will also be introduced to ATC clearances and departure procedures.

Objectives
The stage one objective is to teach the student aeronautical knowledge related to pre-flight procedures, aircraft systems related to IFR operations, upset recovery, ATC clearances and departure procedures.. Additionally, introduce the student to aeronautical experience and build a foundation for flight path management, CRM, SRM, ADM, and task management. 

Completion Standards
The student should be able to control the aircraft to ACS standards while multitasking. The student will also pass the Systems Validation with a minimum of 80%.
